# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Sales Dataset

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted as part of an internship task at Neuron Labs. The project involves analyzing a sales dataset to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and is available at the following URL:
[Kaggle Dataset - Practice EDA on this Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvkothari19/practice-eda-on-this-sales-dataset)

The dataset provides information about sales transactions, including order details, products, quantities, prices, order dates, and purchase addresses.

## Objective

The main objectives of this EDA project are as follows:
- Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data as needed.
- Explore the data to identify patterns, trends, and insights.
- Visualize key aspects of the data using various plots and charts.
- Answer specific business-related questions using data analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `data/`: This directory contains the raw dataset file(s).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook(s) used for data analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing or specific analysis tasks.
- `results/`: Visualizations, charts, or any generated output from the analysis.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
